    VTubers are considered to have great appeal in that they are not bound by
    physical limitations and many of them engage in activities that are
    unconstrained by real-world sex and gender.[4] VTubers are associated with
    Japanese popular culture and aesthetics, such as anime and manga,[4] and moe
    anthropomorphism with human or non-human traits.[4] Some VTubers are
    anthropomorphic, non-human characters such as animals.[5]
