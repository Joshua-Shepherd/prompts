    Table 2.1
    Contentful conjunctions that illustrate coherence relations
    
    Relation              : Conjunction
    Cause-effect          : because, and so                                                                                                                              
    Violated expectation  : although, but, while                                                                                                                         
    Condition             : if... (then), as long as, while                                                                                                              
    Similarity            : and, (and) similarly                                                                                                                         
    Contrast              : by contrast, but                                                                                                                             
    Temporal sequence     : (and) then; first, second,... ; before; after; while                                                                                         
    Attribution           : according to... ,... said, claim that... , maintain that... , stated that...                                                                 
    Example               : For example, for instance                                                                                                                    
    Elaboration           : also, furthermore, in addition, notice (furthermore) that, (for, in, on, against, with,...) which, who, (for, in, on, against, with,...) whom
    Generalization        : in general
    
    (26) Condition
    a. If the new software works,    
    b. everyone should be happy.
    
    In the violated expectation relation (also used by Hobbs), a causal relation that would
    normally exist between two discourse segments is absent. For example, (27a) would nor-
    mally be a cause for everyone to be happy, but this expectation is violated by the content
    
    of (27b).
    (27) Violated Expectation
    a. The new software worked great,
    b. but nobody was happy.
