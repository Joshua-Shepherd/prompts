  This is ok and I'm not sure if there is a
  better way, but the LM could be better.
prompt: |+
    I was given the following passage,
    "Make it better." and I was tasked to repeat that but
    "be more verbose and articulate".
    This was my response:
    "Improve it in all the necessary ways in order for it to be more suitable."
    my feedback was that it was indeed more verbose and articulate.
    I was then given the following passage,
    "<document>." and I was tasked to repeat it but
    "<transformation>."
    This was what I came up with:
    "
