  This is the error I get:
  <delim>
  <ghci output>
  <delim>

  # Code which is causing the error:

  Your code should look like the following:
  <delim>
  
engine: "OpenAI Codex"
temperature: 0.3
max-generated-tokens: "(* 2 prompt-length)"
delimiter: "```"
top-p: 1.0
stop-sequences:
- "<delim>"
cache: on
vars:
- "ghci output"
- "code segment"
defs:
- language: "(pen-detect-language)"
filter: off
info: on
completion: off
insertion: off
