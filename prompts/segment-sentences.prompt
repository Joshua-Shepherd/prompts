    This anonymous gold coinage appears to have been initiated shortly before
    Rajaraja Chola invaded Lanka in 990 AD, and struck through the period when
    the Cholas dominated the island (1017-1070), and continued by closely
    similar coins struck for Vijayabahu (1055-1110) after he re-established
    Sinhala independence in 1070.
