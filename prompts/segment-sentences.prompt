    This anonymous gold coinage appears to have been initiated shortly before
    Rajaraja Chola invaded Lanka in 990 AD, and struck through the period when
    the Cholas dominated the island (1017-1070), and continued by closely
    similar coins struck for Vijayabahu (1055-1110) after he re-established
    Sinhala independence in 1070. Like other Lankan coins from around the 11th
    Century, no date is indicated. It is not certain whether the Kahavanu was
    introduced at Ruhuna, the region in the south of the island to which the
    Sinhala court had been obliged to move as a result of Rajaraja's conquests.
