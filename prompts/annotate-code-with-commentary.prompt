  Annotate the code with comments.

  Code:
  ```awk
  BEGIN {
      window = 4
      slide = 2
  }

  {
      if(NR == 1)
          print "coord",$6,$7
  }

  (NR % slide) == 0 {
      print NR,sum/count,sum2/count
  }
  ```
  Annotated code:
  ```awk
  # When the program starts
  BEGIN {
      # Set window and slide
      window = 4
      slide = 2
  }

  # For each record in the file
  {
      # If first record, print the 6th and 7th columns
      if(NR == 1)
          print "coord",$6,$7
  }

  # For every slidth line
  (NR % slide) == 0 {
      # print the record number and averages
      print NR,sum/count,sum2/count
  }
  ```
