  Help, my code is not compiling.

  This is the error I get:
  <delim>
  <compiler/linter output>
  <delim>

  # Code which is causing the error:
  <delim>
  <code segment>
  <delim>

  Your code should look like the following:
  <delim>
  
engine: "OpenAI Codex"
temperature: 0.3
max-generated-tokens: "(* 2 prompt-length)"
delimiter: "```"
top-p: 1.0
stop-sequences:
- "<delim>"
cache: on
vars:
- "compiler/linter output"
- "code segment"
defs:
- language: "(pen-detect-language)"
var-defaults:
- "(pen-list2str (pen-lsp-error-list))"
- "(pen-selection)"
